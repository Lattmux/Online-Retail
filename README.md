## üõç Online Retail Sales Analysis (SQL_Project)

In this project, I used SQL to analyze sales and customer behavior in an online retail dataset. It covers, sales performance, customer segmentation, product popularity, Revenue trends, and also customer value insights.

##  Source of Dataset
- *Source*: Online Retail (Kaggle)
- *Table Used*: online_retail
- *Key Columns*: InvoiceNo, Description, Quantity, UnitPrice, InvoiceDate, CustomerID, Country

##  Project Objectives

1. *Customer Segmentation*
   - Categorizing customers based on frequency of purchace (one-time, repeat, high-value).

2. Product Category Performance
   - Product Categorization (e.g., BLUE, CREAM, ROSE)
   - Revenue by Category

3. *Revenue Insights*
   - Analyze total revenue by business segment and by country.
   - Top countries by revenue performance.

4. *Product Analysis*
   - Identify the ten products with the highest purchase volume.
   - Country-wise distribution of the leading products.

5. *Monthly Sales Trend*
   - Monthly Sales Trends: Spotting Seasonal Highs and Lows.

6. *CCustomer Lifetime Value (CLV)
   - Revenue per customer.
   - Top 5 customers by amount spent.

##  Illustrative SQL Logic and Queries

- *Customer Segmentation*
```sql
SELECT 
  CustomerID,
  COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceNo) AS purchase_frequency,
  CASE
    WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceNo) = 1 THEN 'OneTime-purchase'
    WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceNo) BETWEEN 2 AND 6 THEN 'Repeat-purchase'
    ELSE 'High-purchase'
  END AS Customer_Segmentation
FROM online_retail
GROUP BY CustomerID;

- *Top 10 Products*
SELECT 
  Description, 
  SUM(Quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM online_retail
GROUP BY Description
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;

- *Revenue generated by Country*
SELECT 
  Country, 
  ROUND(SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice), 2) AS Total_sales_revenue
FROM online_retail
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY Total_sales_revenue DESC;
